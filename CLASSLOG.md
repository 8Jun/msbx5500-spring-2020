Dave soliloquied about think-aloud protocol and rubber duck programming for
working through tough problems and writing and debugging code.

We attempted a collaborative job search but got depressed, jaded, and overly
cynical after reading the first promoted posting on linkedin under "data scientist."
Filtering the listings by experience level was somewhat helpful. Collected various
technologies that we may add to our portfolios in order to signal intelligence and
with-it-ism.

We played a bit with github, and had the students join the class "repo." Github Teams is
better than a shared private repo, because collaborators on private repos by default
all have push access to the repo, and I do not trust my students to not unintentionally
or otherwise wreck the class repo. Github Teams allows more granular access permissions.

Will meet again this week to discuss invidiual goals and progress with and for job applications,
and also to discuss potential side projects.

Triscuits were popular but seriously who eats barbeque chips at 9am. Next
time will be triscuits, apples, and cheese sticks.

Interviews with each student during office hours. Goal was to check in with each student
about their job-search status, desires, etc. Students exhorted to have at least three-ish
actual job postings in mind, and to build out portfolio for those jobs. Dave attempted
to light a fire under proverbial students to get them to start applying _now_.

Spent first part of class comparing notes and strategizing about job applications. Business
value / costs of false positives versus false negatives were pondered, including resumes and early rounds 
of interviews as "signaling" events. 

Second half was dedicated to sundry questions about using git and setting up a personal website using github pages,
jekyll, etc. A few questions related to the Kaggle machine learning questions were addressed.

Business analytics class midterms were posted, and students were assigned to take both. Open-notes, open feedback.
I told the students that I had them take the midterms the exams as a way to help them know some of the things
that I think a b-school data analyst graduate should know.

Stomach illness went around this week, beginning with Saturday previous.
