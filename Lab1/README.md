# Lab 1

## Learning Objectives

* review how the job market looks
* get feet wet with python jupyter notebooks and the insanity that is the current landscape of the new hotness for the same
* get good at talking about business analytics with people who have no idea, and also with people who have some idea
* practice learning things on your own, together


I want you to fork this repo, *make a copy of this file (leave this copy alone so that it can be updated!)*, and fill out the 
below very-length-list of things to do. Use the github flow feature-branch pull-request method to ask me for feedback.

I'll have you merge this file if I change it.

The next time we meet, we'll share experiences and lessons learned from working on this lab.


### Note-taking 

Key to completing this lab is to log like me -- 

* [ ] learn how to think and learn like me, via writing a "madman's flow of consciousness log"
	* [ ] keep a log of struggles that you have for each task, mini questions that you have, paths you explore for answering that task
	* [ ] when I begin a large task, the key for me is to identify mini, conquerable subtasks that will help me complete the bigger task. 
       I have to articulate what I do not know, and then I have to learn how to learn that. I have to gather domain vocabulary words and phrases 
       in order to do better information searches. I have to learn to become discerning in my information search. And I have to get good at really rough note-taking.
       
Please keep your notes in markdown-format in your repo for this class. Me reviewing it will help me help you learn. We'll talk more about this.



## Deliverable

### demonstrate skills
* [ ] create a github account
* [ ] create a web presence on github where you can display your work
	* [ ] use jekyll for a dead-simple-yet-impressive blogging website
* [ ] learn github
	* [ ] learn github flow
	* [ ] learn to keep a changelog
* [ ] learn markdown
* [ ] learn git
* [ ] do sagemaker tutorial
	* [ ] next time, we will deploy an endpoint and make predictions!
		* [ ] in the later future, we will make an endpoint for doing fraud prediction, and modify it to have an api that we can hit from a website we make!
			* [ ] in the later future after that, we will use sagemaker studio!
				* [ ] in the later future after that, we will use our laptops to power a small satellite!
* [ ] do colab tutorial
* [ ] do a kaggle tutorial for python machine learning

### Gain knowledge and become conversant in...
This section is about not sounding and looking like an idiot when talking about business analytics in e.g. interview or networking setting

* [ ] how does the job market look
	* [ ] what keywords do you find that are most related to business analytics -- e.g., data analyst, machine learning, 
	* [ ] for those jobs, what skills are being asked for? what kinds of skills?
	* [ ] for those job skills,
		* [ ] which do you feel that you already have, and that you can demonstrate that you have?
		* [ ] which do you think are within-reach?
	* [ ] what tentative goals do you want to set for yourself for this semester for how to become a stronger job candidate?
* [ ] read Business Analytics chapters that help them answer the questions:
	* [ ] what is business analytics?
	* [ ] why learn about business analytics if the job role won't be an analyst -- what job roles involve analytics?
	* [ ] what is predictive analytics? what is supervised analytics, and what is unsupervised analytics?
	* [ ] what is a target? what are features? What are dependent variables, and independent variables?
	* [ ] what is a model?
* [ ] what is jupyter, how does it relate to python, where can one find a jupyter, contrast with anaconda and local notebooks
* [ ] what is AWS, what is sagemaker, how does it compare with google Colab
