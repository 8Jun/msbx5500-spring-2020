# **Elevator Pitch**

## What is business analytics?
* Business analytics is a field that uses data to improve decision making (DDD). It is a mix between computer science, management and business (data science for business).

## Why learn about business analytics if the job role won't be an analyst -- what job roles involve analytics?
* It is important to learn about business analytics because being able to know how to use data is key to keeping a competitive edge
in the market. Jobs that involve analytics range from marketing to data scientist and everything inbetween. There is always a
component of analytics in each role a business offers.

## What is predictive analytics? what is supervised analytics, and what is unsupervised analytics?
* "Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data." - SAS
* Supervised analytics is asking the question "is there a specific target".
* Unsupervised analytics is having no specific target for grouping.

## What is a target? what are features? What are dependent variables, and independent variables?
* A target is the final output you are trying to predict (the y) and can be categorical (Yes or No) or continuous (price of a house).
* Features are the properties you feed the model in order to make its prediction. The quality of the features will have a major 
impact on the insights one will gain from the dataset when one uses it for ML.
## What is a model?
* A model is a simplified representation of reality created to serve a purpose.

## What is jupyter, how does it relate to python, where can one find a jupyter, contrast with anaconda and local notebooks
* Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. One can script and run python code in a jupyter notebook along with
other languages such as R, Julia, Scala and many more. Jupyter can be found at https://jupyter.org/.

## What is AWS, what is sagemaker, how does it compare with google Colab
* AWS or Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.
* Amazon SageMaker is a cloud machine-learning platform that was launched in November 2017. SageMaker enables developers to create, train, and deploy machine-learning models in the cloud. SageMaker also enables developers to deploy ML models on embedded systems and edge-devices.
* Google Cloud Datalab is a standalone serverless platform. It is used for building and deploying ML models. It has to be used with other services like the Google Cloud ML to make it a more powerful ML service. Whereas Amazon SageMaker is built for complete end-to-end ML services.
